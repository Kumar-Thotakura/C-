#include <queue>   //It CONSISTS AN HEADERFILE AS QUEUE

CONSIDER QUEUE WILL BE LIKE AS :  
                                  ------------------------
                                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                                  ------------------------


//DECLERATION OF THE QUEUE
queue <data_type> q;    

//TO ADD NEW ELEMENTS AT THE END OF THE QUEUE
q.push();
q.emplace();

//TO REMOVE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE AT THE START OF THE QUEUE
q.pop();

//TO SEE THE ELEMENTS AT THE TOP(OR)FRONT OF THE QUEUE
q.front();

//TO SEE THE ELEMENTS AT THE END(OR)BACK OF THE QUEUE
q.back();

//TO FIND THE SIZE OF THE QUEUE
q.size();

//TO FIND THAT WETHER THE QUEUE IS EMPTY OR NOT
q.empty();  //since it is a boolean return type .Hence it says that the queue is empty or not

//TO EXCHANGE THE DATA FROM ONE QUEUE TO ANOTHER QUEUE
q2.swap(q1);  //the elements in q1 will transfer to q2  ;  and the elements in q2 will transfers to q1
